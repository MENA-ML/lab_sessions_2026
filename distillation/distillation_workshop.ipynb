Introduction: What is Knowledge Distillation?\n","\n","**Knowledge Distillation** is a technique whereby a student neural network learns from another, usually already pre-trained neural network. KD can be used for compressing the model, in which case the student is smaller. It can also be used for improving model performance, where the student is the same or even larger than the teacher. In either case, the the student is trained to mimic the behavior of one or more teacher models.\n","\n","### Why do we need it?\n","\n","- **Deployment constraints**: Large models are expensive to run on edge devices, mobile phones, or in real-time applications\n","- **Inference speed**: Smaller models are faster\n","- **Cost reduction**: Less compute = less money and energy\n","- **Increased performance**: Sometimes KD is used to increase the performance of our model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-h9dET-pU2Kh"},"source":["\n","\n","\n","## Learning Objectives\n","\n","By the end of this workshop, you will:\n","1.
