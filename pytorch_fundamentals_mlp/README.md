# 🧠 PyTorch Fundamentals: Building Your First MLP

**Facilitators:** Gergo Ignacz (KAUST), Amr Khalifa (GDM)
**Track:** Foundational  

## 📖 Session Overview
This session serves as the entry point into the world of Deep Learning with **PyTorch**. It takes you from the very basics of tensor manipulation to building, training, and evaluating your first neural network—a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

## 📊 The Data
The Session uses an on-the-go generated XOR dataset, which is the pedagogically perfect example of teaching MLPs, because it's the simplest problem that requires a hidden layer!

## ⚠️ Requirements
This notebook is designed to be run smoothly on both GPU and CPU runtime.
