# 🧠 PyTorch Fundamentals: Building Your First MLP

**Facilitators:** Amr Khalifa (GDM), Gergo Ignacz (KAUST)  
**Track:** Foundational  

## 📖 Session Overview
This session serves as the entry point into the world of Deep Learning with **PyTorch**. It takes you from the very basics of tensor manipulation to building, training, and evaluating your first neural network—a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

## 📊 The Data
The session utilizes the **MNIST Dataset**, a standard benchmark in machine learning consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## ⚠️ Requirements
This notebook is designed to run on a **GPU Runtime** to accelerate model training.
