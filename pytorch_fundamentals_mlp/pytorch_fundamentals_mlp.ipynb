To define a dataset in PyTorch, we simply specify two functions: `__getitem__`, and `__len__`. The get-item function has to return the n-th data point in the dataset, while the len function returns the size of the dataset. For the XOR dataset, we can define the dataset class as follows:"],"metadata":{"id":"aVn8gMwthBZh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# This data generator is defined for you (now!)\n","class XORDataset(data.Dataset):\n","    def __init__(self, size, std=0.1):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Inputs:\n","            size - Number of data points we want to generate\n","            std - Standard deviation of the noise (see generate_continuous_xor function)\n","        \"\"\"\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.size = size\n","        self.std = std # we need this to add the small noise\n","        self.generate_continuous_xor()\n","        torch.manual_seed(1)\n","\n","    def generate_continuous_xor(self):\n","        # Each data point in the XOR dataset has two variables, x and y, that can be either 0 or 1\n","        # The label is their XOR combination, i.e. 1 if only x or only y is 1 while the other is 0.\n","        # If x=y, the label is 0.\n","        data = torch.randint(low=0, high=2, size=(self.size, 2), dtype=torch.float32)\n","        label = (data.sum(dim=1) == 1).to(torch.long)\n","        # To make it slightly more challenging, we add a bit of gaussian noise to the data points.\n","        data += self.std * torch.randn(data.shape)\n","\n","        self.data = data\n","        self.label = label\n","\n","    def __len__(self):\n","        # Number of data point we have.
