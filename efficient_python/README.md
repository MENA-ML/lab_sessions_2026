# 🐍 Efficient Python & PyTorch: Optimization Gym

**Facilitator:** Tamara Norman (Google DeepMind)  
**Track:** Foundational  

## 📖 Session Overview
This hands-on gym session is designed to help you write faster, cleaner, and **more efficient Python code**, with a specific focus on optimizing PyTorch pipelines.

You will learn to identify bottlenecks, leverage vectorization, and utilize JIT compilation to speed up your deep learning workflows. The session combines theoretical best practices with practical profiling exercises.

## ⚠️ Requirements
This notebook is designed to run on a **GPU Runtime** to demonstrate the speedups in PyTorch and JAX.
